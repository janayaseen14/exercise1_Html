              Hello, my name is Jana. I am 19 years old. I study computer
              systems engineering at Palestine Technical University, Kadoorie. I
              learned CSS, HTML, and responsive design, and I am currently
              learning web development with Gaza Sky Geeks (:

        <li><b>Icream</b></li>
        <!-- First project -->
        <p>
          In this project, I used html and css to build a web page related to
          ice cream, <br />
          which contains some ice cream prices, some famous ice cream chefs, and
          many things related to ice cream. <br /><br />

        <li><b>Css Task</b></li>
        <!-- Second project -->
        <p>
          This is the first project in which I used css. <br />It is simple, but
          it was training for me to learn how to use css. I used many of the
          features of css. <br /><br />

        <!-- Third project -->
        <p>
          This is the project that you requested from us when we submitted an
          application to join the web development course, <br />
          in which I used html and css. This project includes an overview of me,
          my skills, and how to communicate with me. <br /><br />
